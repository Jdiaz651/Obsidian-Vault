# Introduction to Data Mining (CAP4770)

## What is Data Mining?
- Process of finding hidden relationships, connections, and patterns in large datasets
- Interchangeable with term "Knowledge Discovery from Data (KDD)"
- Crucial due to exponential growth of data (doubles every ~2 years)
- Handles both structured and unstructured data (numbers, dates, text, audio, images, video)

## Knowledge Discovery Process
1. **Data Preparation**
   - Remove noise
   - Integrate multiple data sources
   - Transform data into mining-suitable forms
   - Select relevant data

2. **Data Mining**
   - Extract patterns
   - Construct models

3. **Pattern/Model Evaluation**
   - Identify relevant patterns
   - Validate models

4. **Knowledge Representation**
   - Present obtained knowledge
   - Visualize findings

## Data Mining Methods
### Types of Mining
- **Descriptive Mining**
  - Uncovers relationships in data structure
  - Example: Data summarization
- **Predictive Mining**
  - Creates models for future predictions
  - Example: Decision trees for classification

### Core Functionalities
1. **Multidimensional Data Summarization**
   - Creates concise data descriptions
   - Uses pie charts, bar charts, data cubes

2. **Pattern Mining**
   - Discovers relationships between items
   - Focuses on associations and correlations

3. **Classification**
   - Builds models for describing data classes
   - Used for categorizing new objects

4. **Cluster Analysis**
   - Groups objects based on properties
   - Objects in same cluster have high similarity
   - Objects in different clusters have low similarity

5. **Deep Learning**
   - Identifies meaningful features in datasets

6. **Outlier Analysis**
   - Identifies significantly different data objects
