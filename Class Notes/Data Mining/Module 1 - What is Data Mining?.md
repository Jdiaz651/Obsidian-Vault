# Introduction to Data Mining (CAP4770) - Module 1

## What is Data Mining?
- Process of discovering patterns and relationships in large datasets
- Also known as "Knowledge Discovery from Data (KDD)"
- Crucial due to exponential data growth (doubles every ~2 years)
- Handles diverse data types:
  - Structured: databases, spreadsheets
  - Unstructured: text, images, audio, video
  - Semi-structured: XML, JSON

## Knowledge Discovery Process
1. **Data Preparation**
   - Data cleaning (remove noise and inconsistencies)
   - Data integration (combine multiple sources)
   - Data transformation (convert to suitable format)
   - Data selection (identify relevant attributes)
   - Example: Combining customer data from website logs and CRM systems

2. **Data Mining**
   - Pattern extraction
   - Model building
   - Algorithm application
   - Feature identification
   - Example: Finding correlations between purchase history and customer demographics

3. **Pattern/Model Evaluation**
   - Pattern validation
   - Model testing
   - Results verification
   - Performance measurement
   - Example: Testing a prediction model against known outcomes

4. **Knowledge Representation**
   - Data visualization
   - Report generation
   - Interactive dashboards
   - Pattern documentation
   - Example: Creating visual dashboards of customer segments
